## AttendanceMarker

The Attendance Marker is a simple Python script I made back in High School that marked my attendance using my school's attendance form.

It uses a python package named PyAutoGUI that is used to automate inputs.

### How it works:
1. It opens Google Chrome
2. Navigates to the google form used for marking student attendances
3. Marks attendance for each person whose ID is stored in the script
4. Displays this gif on the screen:
